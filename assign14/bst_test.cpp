*  File: bst_test.cpp

*  Author: Brother Cameron, 10/23/2001
*
*  Purpose: This program tests the member functions from the BST class.
*           The program reads 25 numbers from a file and inserts them into the BST.
*           It then prints out the tree in infix order.  The program then deletes
*           selected numbers and redisplays the tree in infix order after each delete.
*
*  Limitations: This program does not test the BST Search function.  It is
*               assumed that the remove function uses the search function
*               to find the node to be deleted.
