F(x) =  x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
G(x) =  -x^3 - x^2 - x

P(x) = (F + G)(x) = 1
P(10) = 1

temp1(x) is same as 8x^6 + G(x) or 8x^6 - x^3 - x^2 - x
temp2(x) is same as F(x) or x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
temp3(x) is same as G(x) or -x^3 - x^2 - x

Original functions were:
F(x) =  x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
G(x) =  -x^3 - x^2 - x
