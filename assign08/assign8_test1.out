F(x) =  3x^5 - 2x^3 + 1
G(x) =  -3x^5 + 5x^3 - 7x

P(x) = (F + G)(x) = 3x^3 - 7x + 1
P(-2) = -9

temp1(x) is same as 8x^6 + G(x) or 8x^6 - 3x^5 + 5x^3 - 7x
temp2(x) is same as F(x) or 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 1
temp3(x) is same as G(x) or -3x^5 + 5x^3 - 7x

Original functions were:
F(x) =  3x^5 - 2x^3 + 1
G(x) =  -3x^5 + 5x^3 - 7x
